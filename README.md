The Swarm!, a heavily 'Geometry Wars' inspired 2D shooter with flocking and particles.
 
Created by Jasper Schelling as part of the 'Introduction to Programming' course of the Mediatechnology MSc. Programme at Leiden University.

How to play:

Steer your ship with W / A / S / D

You can aim using the mouse or your laptop's trackpad (this actually works better than I expected)

The objective of the game is quite simple: DON'T DIE.

The swarm will spawn as you play. The longer you leave enemies allive, the faster they become.
as you kill enemies, you'll earn a score, and they'll drop green gems. Collect these gems to gain
power-ups (increase in ship speed, firing rate, and amount of bullets)

How long can you hold out against The Swarm?
